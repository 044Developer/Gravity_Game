# Gravity_Game

My personal game idea of casual game, with an interesting game mechanics. The main goal is to collect golden spheres and avoid spikes, which triggers game over. Red cubes are triggering all circles to rotate in opposite direction, which makes gameplay more interesting and challenging. The main purpose was to build personal pet project with an opportunity to publish game in store. Game creation was stopped, because on a certaion moment of development, game was not so interesting in terms of player satisfaction. Might be resumed later.

Unity version - 2020.2.0f1
